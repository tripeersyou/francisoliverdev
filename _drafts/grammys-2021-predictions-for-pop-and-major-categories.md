Since the 2021 GRAMMY nominations came out last year in 2020, I wanted to try something new. In the past few years I would look at the nominations and forget about it and would have like a few albums that I know, but this year I wanted to listen to all major categories and the few song nominations especially in pop music. So, with this year's GRAMMYs coming up. I would like to share my predications and nominations for the following categories: Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance, Best Pop/Duo Solo Performance, and Best Pop Vocal Album

I will rank them based on my enjoyment of the albums and provide a short explanation at the end for my picks/rankings.

* Album of the Year
  1. **Black Pumas (Deluxe) by Black Pumas**
  2. Women In Music Pt. III by HAIM
  3. Everyday Life by Coldplay
  4. Hollywood's Bleeding by Post Malone
  5. Future Nostalgia by Dua Lipa
  6. Djesse Vol. 3 by Jacob Collier
  7. folklore by Taylor Swift
  8. Chilombo by Jhene Aiko

Out of all the albums in the nominees this list Black Pumas' album is the one I enjoyed the most. This pick might be a bit biased because I prefer music performed on instruments but the beat and the feel of the Black Pumas (Deluxe) is superb. I never really got into the eligibility of the Black Pumas album some people say it's not supposed to be on here because it was not technically released during the period of eligibility but I do not care about that I'm just here for the music. 

Few notes on the other nominees, Everyday Life by Coldplay maybe cheesy for some listeners but it's maybe one of their most inspired works. Jacob Collier's Djesse Vol. 3 is what you expect from him crazy harmonies and complex music theory, but for me it gets kind of old, like he's saying "look at this music theory gimmick we used for this song". The others are just well produced pop albums or albums with good writing but never really gets going and keeps on playing the same sounding song over and over again. 

* Record of the Year
  1. **Colors by Black Pumas**
  2. everything i wanted by Billie Eilish
  3. Don't Start Now by Dua Lipa
  4. Say So by Doja Cat
  5. Circles by Post Malone
  6. Black Parade by Beyonce
  7. Rockstar by DaBabby feat. Roddy Rich
  8. Savage (Remix) by Megan Thee Stallion feat. Beyonce

Colors by Black Pumas is my most enjoyed record out of all the nominees this year. This songs elements, the guitars, the bass, the keys, the vocals and drums are recorded and it feels like its a live performance and it doesn't sound like it comes from a laptop.

Don't Start Now, Say So and Savage (Remix) had a gigantic 2020 year. In terms of the recording aspect of this category, Don't Start Now has this killer baseline that propels not just this song but the entirety of Dua Lipa's sophomore release. Say So by Doja Cat is propelled  by the vocals and the masterful use of post production effects on it (especially on the chorus). Savage (Remix) may be least enjoyed  song but the chords and rhythm is very unique (I might just be the case of being overplayed thanks to TikTok). 

* Song of the Year
  1. **everything i wanted by Billie Eilish**
  2. cardigan by Taylor Swift
  3. Don't Start Now by Dua Lipa
  4. If The World Was Ending by JP Saxe feat. Julia Michaels
  5. I Can't Breathe by H.E.R.
  6. Black Parade by Beyonce
  7. The Box by Roddy Rich

This category is really a two horse race between Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift if we are all being honest. I picked Billie Eilish because I feel like its a much more stronger song, writing wise and the creative production (i.e. EQ change on the vocals to make it sound like Billie is singing underwater to accent a line), FINNEAS and her are on a streak of musically and sonically interesting songs but still palatable to the general public at large. Taylor may not be the best chord progression writer (it hasn't been her strong suit), but her lyrics make up for it and this single from her first surprise quarantine album shows it. When you strip away all the production and focus on the lyrics the detail that she goes into to get her point across in this track, shows how easy it is for her.

* Best Pop Solo Performance
  1. **everything i wanted by Billie Eilish**
  2. cardigan by Taylor Swift
  3. Watermelon Sugar by Harry Styles
  4. Don't Start Now by Dua Lipa
  5. Say So by Doja Cat
  6. Yummy by Justin Bieber

Billie wins this category again based on the reasons laid out on the Song of the Year category of this, but I can see any song on this category winning this category except for Yummy that song shouldn't even be considered for any award but it's here. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

* Best Pop/Duo Solo Performance
  1. **exile by Tayor Swift feat. Bon Iver**
  2. Dynamite by BTS
  3. Rain On Me by Lady Gaga feat. Ariana Grande
  4. Intentions by Justin Bieber feat. Quavo
  5. Un Dia (One Day) by J Balvin, Dua Lipa, Bad Bunny & Tainy

Exile wins this category by a lot. Combine Taylor's superb lyric writing and having Bon Iver for her to have a sort of dialogue in the song totally elevates the song. Dynamite by BTS is just a catchy song with a hook in the chorus but really has no main point but to have it engrained in your ears for BTS to have a more international audience. Intentions by Justin Bieber is just badly written, its bad when Quavo says "asset" like "skkrt" because you have no interesting words in that line except for "asset".

* Best Pop Vocal Album
  1. **Fine Line by Harry Styles**
  2. Future Nostalgia by Dua Lipa
  3. folklore by Taylor Swift
  4. Chromatica by Lady Gaga
  5. Changes by Justin Bieber

Harry Styles' album is a surprise during my listen, it wasn't only just catchy but musically interesting as well. Songs like Golden, She and Falling are in my opinion the best on the record. It seems musically similar to Carly Rae Jepsen's works but the type of music and vibe is totally different. Future Nostalgia and folklore has this problem of all the songs sounding the same, the former just being one disco track after another and your ears are tired of hearing the same tropes after 4 songs, and the latter has the opposite problems Taylor's folk songs never get into another gear like she's stuck on a tempo and style of folk music. Chromatica is Gaga's return to form after Joanne, this release was hampered by the COVID pandemic not having live shows really hampered this album, also Gaga goes full camp on some of the tracks on this record where its almost laughable (i.e. "Unwrap Me" from Sour Candy) but there are good tracks on there like Enigma which shows Gaga's powerful vocals and Babylon and the wordplay in that song (Babble On, Babylon).
